			<h2>Programming </h2>
			<p>I enjoy working on personal projects such as this website. 
				I also enjoy building iOS apps. For Example : <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/splashyking/id1012787891?mt=8">SplashyKing</a></p>
			<h2>Snowboarding </h2>
			<p>Nothing better than hitting the slopes after a some fresh powder drops. You might find me at Greek Peak, Windham, or Hunter.</p>
			<h2>Basketball</h2>
			<p>I'd like to think that if I grew to be over 6' I would have had a shot at professional basketball. JK, but my favorite team is the NY Knicks.</p>
			<h2>Boating</h2>
			<p>Growing up on the south shore of Long Island has been a blessing. My summers are filled with boats, jetskis, and watersports.</p>
